# RajHack3
The Project created by team GopalSevaks during Rajasthan Hackathon 3.0, Udaipur.
Problem Statement
Human Trafficking and Illegal transportation of animals for beef and leather is a big issue which need to addressed with the best technologies and techniques available for service.

Solution
We are determined to create a full fledged location tracking system along with the hardware device implementation of it, that will track an animal actively and thus protect it from any illegal trade by placing the real time information about the animal in the hands of the farmer or owner. The same can also be implemented for children for sure. As soon as the animal or small child cross the safe zone circle (set by the owner/parent on map) a notification will be reached to the owner that something may be wrong and make him attentive to be able to prevent the upcoming danger as a whole in the first place. The concept can be enhanced to have detailed understanding of the mechanism of the working of illegal trade of trafficking. Further, this enhanced system would have many other dominant features to make it worth more, they are: It will fetch and store all the behavioral information about the animal which would be then compared with the standard database of a normal healthy animal and implement machine learning to compare it for any abnormal behavior of that animal signifying it is unhealthy by noting down the symptoms.

24 Hours
In the 24 hours time, we plan to work over the enhancement of our existing features along with the addition of other new features that may be possible for its betterment. Again, the steps for the transformation of our project from local testing phase to the final production phase for the purpose of final presentation and prototype demonstration with the live implementation of our hardware working device will be made.

Competitors
The irony of the present situation is that despite being a technological modern society using GPS technology and various other data science technology in our day to day life, no authority has ever created such a system dedicated to prevention of children or animals trafficking so far. So, we have no competitor in present context, and we are creating for service to humanity and holy cow, by creating our own standards for this system.

Uniqueness
Unfortunately, there is no currently available product of this sort that exists as described above, so it is unique in itself. But, still we strive to make it best possible systematic approach even for the future to come.

Market
For our first phase of implementation we are only considering Rajasthan as our working state. Market Potential: According to Census 2012 Reports, the state has population of 6.9 crore. According to Niti Ayog among them 2/3 of population depends upon agriculture. We also consitute 10% of the animal population of the country. According to Animal Husbandry Census 2012, we have 577.32lacs Livestock with maximum that in Jaipur, Sikar, Ganganagar and Jhunjhunu among top, with the state being completely beef banned. Also National Crime Records Bureau states that Rajasthan is 2nd state in human trafficking cases registered with 70-80% as children or women on the surrounding of Jaipur-Delhi National Highway. While our main concern in our first phase will be on the livestock tracking, keeping the fact in mind that 53% of the farmers in Rajasthan has less than 0.63 hectares of land, So our prime focus would be on rest of the 47% farmers who could invest for the devices. Revenue Estimate: Taking care of the farmers population and also the concerned parents about child trafficking we may have no firm estimation of the revenue, as it firmly depends on the approach of the society to this new concept of abolishing trafficking.

Make Money
While the purpose of our project is not solely to make money but to serve the society. The revenue streams for our startup would be initially on the contract basis. Further we will have some royalty money assigned for our each hardware device sold. The estimated device cost will be based on the production process, but after optimum minimization we plan to set the cost of each device up to ₹100, in which around ₹10 will be the royalty return for us.

Tech Stack
We are planning to use:
Javascript for the back-end with Firebase, NodeJS.
Database: MySql or Firebase.
Data Science: Python NumPy.
Google Map APIs implemented using Javascript, and other useful Google APIs, with JSON using AngularJS where required.
APIS related to GPS technologies such as gpstrackfit, movingongps are considered for use.
Version Control System: GitHub
Hosting Environment: Heroku
The Hasura development environment is also considerable to use. 

Team Talent
We are assured to create this project a reality on the basis of the talent and strength of our team. Here are some details over each of our member: Bablu Singh: A diligent tech talent with affluence in Back-end and database coupled with a wide experience in Java based applications. Chandra Prakash: The man with Python possessed in his blood stream is incomparable tech geek. Inesh Badra: Our intelligent tech-savvy hard-worker is repleted with a lot of practical on field experience. Kartik Arora: This Javascript lover with miscellaneous skills will add to the skill sets. So with this Super Talented team in our side, we are confident enough to produce the product in physical platform.

Help Required
Besides the fact that we have a highly talented team to make it through, still if we can have some assistance with the advanced use of google maps and various operations performed over it, this would be a great help.
